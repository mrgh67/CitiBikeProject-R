Predicting Citibike Bike Speeds

Can bikespeeds be predicted for those riders using the Citibikes in New York City?
Although the exact route, and therefore the precise distance travelled, is unknown for an given rider with some assumptions and enough data speed prediction is possible. The influence of weather and geography is also investigated.

By subsetting the data the aim is to find the real "go-getters" between any 2 stations. These are the folks who are not out for a pleasant cycle, taking a circuitous, winding or touristy route. These are the folks who use Citibikes day-in day-out to get from A to B in the fatest possible time. By subsetting the data to analysing only the fatestest journeys between any 2 Citibike stations it is hoped we are looking at a subset of riders who, indeed, use the bikes to go from A to B in the shortest time possible. A further assumption therefore, is that they follow the most efficient route possible between any 2 given stations. If these assumptions are correct, and we estimate distance in a consistent fashion, then we can estimate their speeds.
